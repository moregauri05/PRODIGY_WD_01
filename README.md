As part of my Web Development Internship at Prodigy Infotech, I was assigned Task 1, which involved designing and developing a responsive landing page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The objective of this task was to implement a visually appealing and functional landing page that demonstrates understanding of front-end web technologies and responsive design principles.
